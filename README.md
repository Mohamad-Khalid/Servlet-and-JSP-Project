# Factorial and Age Calculator - Java Servlet and JSP
### Project Description
This project implements two tasks using Java Servlets, JSP, and HTML to create a Factorial Table and an Age Calculator. The application allows users to generate a table containing factorials for numbers from 0 to a specified input. It also provides a user-friendly form to input a date of birth and calculates the age in years, months, days, and hours.
### Features
- Factorial Table:
  - Users can input a number to generate a factorial table.
  - The table displays factorials for numbers from 0 to the user-input number.
  - Factorials are calculated server-side using Java Servlets.
- Age Calculator:
  - Users can input their date of birth using a user-friendly form.
  - The application calculates the age based on the entered date of birth.
  - The age is calculated in years, months, days, and hours.
  - Age calculation is performed server-side using Java Servlets.
### Tech Stack
- `Java Servlets`: Backend logic and factorial calculation.
- `JSP` (JavaServer Pages): View templates for presenting data to users.
- `HTML` and `CSS`: Frontend design for the Factorial Table and Age Calculator.
- `Tomcat Server`: Deployment and running the application locally.
- `Maven`: Project management and dependencies.
### Usage
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Ensure you have Java, Maven, and a servlet container like Apache Tomcat installed.
- Configure the Tomcat server in your IDE or manually deploy the project on the server.
- Run the application on http://localhost:8080.
- Access the Factorial Table by entering a number and submitting the form.
- Use the Age Calculator form to input your date of birth and calculate your age.
